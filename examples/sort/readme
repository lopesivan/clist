This is a simple demonstration of how to use the clist sort and related functions.  Just compile/link and execute the 'main.cpp' file.  You should also read the 'tutorial' so that some of the concepts are clear (such as inverting).  Make sure that the 'ta0kira' folder is in your include path before compiling!
